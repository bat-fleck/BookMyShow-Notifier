# BookMyShow Notifier

This script gives you a notification when booking opens for a particular movie on bookmyshow.

## How it works

The python code scrapes the given url every hour and checks if the span element "__text" exists or not.

## Getting Started

Just change the __urlMovie__ variable inside the script to the url of the upcoming movie.
